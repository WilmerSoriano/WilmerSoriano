At heart I am a gamer🎮, manga reader📖, and Computer Scientist💾🖥️.

I aspire to be part of projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible, whether it’s through software development, artificial intelligence, or data science.
My goal is to leave a lasting mark in the field by creating solutions that empower people and make technology more accessible to all.

With every project I take on, I’m committed to learning, growing, and applying my knowledge to create something meaningful.
I believe that with the right mindset and perseverance, anyone can make a difference—and I’m excited to continue on this path to see where it leads.
